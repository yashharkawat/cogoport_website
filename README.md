# cogoport_website

Some problems I faced during the assessments :

1) When we scroll the cogoport website the navigation bar changes color from yellow to white .I think it is done with the help of javascript. I am not able to change the color of navigation bar, So I have kept it yellow.
2) On the cogoport website the whatsapp icon is only displayed when scroll down to a certain level. I was not able to figure out how it was done. So I just made the whatsapp icon and made it sticky
   
I have tried to solve the above problems but cannot find the solution.

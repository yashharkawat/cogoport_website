# cogoport_website

Some problems I faced during the assessments :

1) I am not able to add the laptop image which is connected by four arrow images in "How it Works" section.
2) I could not reduce the difference between the homepage video and the "get faster with cogoport " Section. Some margin is coming between them even though I am not adding it. They are just above the blogs section.
3) When we scroll the cogoport website the navigation bar changes color from yellow to white .I think it is done with the help of javascript. I am not able to change the color of navigation bar, So I have kept it yellow.

I have tried to solve all the above problems but cannot find the solution. I would solve these issues at the earliest, so that my website look exactly same as cogoport website.

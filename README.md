# cogoport_website

Some problems I faced during the assessments :

1) When we scroll the cogoport website the navigation bar changes color from yellow to white .I think it is done with the help of javascript. I am not able to change the color of navigation bar, So I have kept it yellow.

I have tried to solve the above problem but cannot find the solution.
